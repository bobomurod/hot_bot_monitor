However, you will need PM2 process manager on your instance to properly run monitoring bot, just type ```npm i pm2 -g``` to install PM2 or go to official website for proper documentation.
So, do other instruction below:

* ```git clone ``` this project
* go to project folder and ```npm install```
* see the ```.env.example``` file and save your own as ```.env```
* type ```pm2 start script.js``` to run the script

good luck
